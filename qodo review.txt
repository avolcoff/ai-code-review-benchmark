PR Reviewer Guide üîç
Here are some key observations to aid the review process:

‚è±Ô∏è Estimated effort to review: 5 üîµüîµüîµüîµüîµ
üß™ No relevant tests
üîí Security concerns

Extensive vulnerabilities:

Hardcoded secrets/credentials across repo (env.example sensitive placeholders; auth-service.js lines with DB creds and JWT secret; Angular/iOS/Android hardcoded API keys/secrets).
SQL injection: Direct string interpolation in SQL queries (auth-service.js getUserById/search/authenticate; Angular building SQL in client; data-processor.py multiple queries; mobile platforms too).
Weak cryptography: MD5 for password hashing (JS, Kotlin, Swift), insecure random tokens (Math.random/Random), base64 ‚Äútokens‚Äù.
Command injection/unsafe execution: exec/Runtime/Process with unvalidated paths/commands (image processing).
XSS: Rendering unsanitized HTML and explicit script tags in backend rendering and Angular component; Flask render_template_string with f-strings; mobile WebView loadData with user input.
Insecure deserialization: eval in JS and Angular, pickle loads, JSON.parse of untrusted with secrets, Kotlin ScriptEngine eval.
Sensitive data exposure: Logging full user objects and errors with stacks; displaying/storing passwords and credit cards; plaintext storage in files and local/session storage.
Insecure cookies/session: httpOnly false, secure false, SameSite none; global sessions without protection.
File handling: Unvalidated file paths, world-writable permissions (0o777), reading arbitrary files, directory listing.
Open redirect: Client and server-side redirects to arbitrary URLs.
Performance issues: N+1 queries and synchronous FS operations in Node utils.
These must be addressed before merge.

‚ö° Recommended focus areas for review

Multiple Critical Vulns
Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection via string interpolation, weak MD5 password hashing, insecure token generation/encoding (base64), XSS in HTML render, unsafe exec of system commands, insecure cookies, eval-based deserialization, broad file/FS access, and logging of sensitive data. Validate and replace with parameterized queries, strong hashing, proper JWT, sanitization, safe exec, secure cookie flags, and remove secrets from code.

XSS and Secret Leakage
Uses bypassSecurityTrustHtml with user input enabling XSS, displays plaintext passwords, hardcoded API/JWT secrets in client, builds SQL query from user input, stores sensitive data in local/session storage, eval on input, open redirects, insecure cookies, logs PII. Remove secrets, sanitize/escape, use server-side parameterized queries and safe templating, and avoid storing sensitive data client-side.

Code Injection/Unsafe Ops
SQL injection via f-strings, MD5 hashing, shell=True command execution, pickle (RCE), eval usage, insecure JWT payload including password, insecure cookies, open redirect, XSS via render_template_string, sensitive data logging/storage, world-writable files. Replace with parameterized queries, safe serializers, no eval/pickle, proper JWT, and secure cookie/FS handling.
