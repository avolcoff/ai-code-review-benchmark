Greptile Summary
This PR establishes a comprehensive multi-platform user management system designed as an AI code review benchmark. The changes introduce a complete application stack including Node.js/Express backend with JWT authentication, Angular frontend component, iOS Swift and Android Kotlin mobile implementations, and Python utilities. The project is structured with proper package management (package.json), environment configuration (env.example), and comprehensive documentation (README.md).

The codebase intentionally contains numerous security vulnerabilities across all platforms to serve as a testing ground for AI code review tools. This is evidenced by class names like VulnerableUserService, SecurityIssuesActivity, and VulnerableComponent, along with the repository name 'ai-code-review-benchmark'. The system includes both legitimate production-style code (proper Express setup, security middleware, bcrypt hashing) and deliberately vulnerable implementations featuring SQL injection, XSS attacks, command injection, hardcoded secrets, and weak authentication patterns.

Two AI code review outputs are also included (greptile review high.txt and coderabbit review.txt), suggesting this benchmark is being used to compare different automated review tools' capabilities in detecting security vulnerabilities across multiple programming languages and platforms.

Important Files Changed
Click to expand file changes
Confidence score: 1/5
This PR requires extreme caution as it contains numerous intentionally vulnerable components that would cause immediate security breaches if deployed
Score reflects the deliberate inclusion of critical security vulnerabilities across all platform implementations, despite being designed for testing purposes
Pay close attention to app.js, src/backend/services/user-service.js, and all security-related service files which contain production-breaking issues

logic: N+1 query problem - this will execute one query per user plus the initial query, causing severe performance issues with large datasets

@greptile-apps greptile-apps bot 2 hours ago
logic: Synchronous file operation in async function blocks the event loop - use fs.readFile or fs.promises.readFile instead

Suggested change
            const content = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');

@greptile-apps greptile-apps bot 2 hours ago
logic: this.isAdmin() returns a Promise but is used synchronously here. This will always evaluate to true since Promises are truthy objects. Use await this.isAdmin(requestingUserId) instead.

@greptile-apps greptile-apps bot 2 hours ago
logic: SQL injection vulnerability in search query construction

logic: Same async/sync issue - this.isAdmin() returns a Promise but is used without await, causing authorization bypass.
